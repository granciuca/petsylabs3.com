                “I’ve been giving my dog Canine Booster daily for the last month
                and a half and I started to notice big changes in his
                well-being. Leni is 12 years old and he’s had problems with
                joints and mobility for some time now. He also didn't really
                want to play anymore and slept all the time which was difficult
                to watch. Since he found it difficult to get up we stopped
                taking him on longer walks and I didnt know what else to do…
                That is until we found Canine Booster online and saw first
                results after just 2 weeks of giving it to Leni. He became more
                energetic and brought me a ball to play for the first time in
                years. I almost cried. After a month the real difference
                showed.. We went for a 6km walk for the first time in 3 years. I
                am definitely ordering Canine Booster again and recommend it to
                all those with older dogs.”

            Canine Booster was originally made as a food supplement that helps
            with the current well-being of your dog -reduces joint stiffness,
            balances gut and helps digestion, builds up the immune system and
            fights inflammation.
            <br />
            <br />
            Quite soon it became obvious it also works preventatively! Since it
            feeds the dog’s organism with vitally important substances it should
            be taken by dogs from 1. year of age on.

                unknown germ. The vet hasn’t been able to help for 5 years, my
                dog has only been given pain medication. I have been giving him
                Canine Booster for 3 weeks now and he is doing a bit better and

                Our dog Lina no longer licks herself, doesn't eat grass anymore
                and has her appetite and energy back, plays and runs around and
                clearly seems to be having fun, like she is a puppy again. She
                is white and her paws and parts of her legs were regularly red
                and licked, and some of her fur was even missing. After adding
                Canine Booster to her diet her paws are fluffy and white again,
                she looks overall whiter and her fur is firmer and shinier. It
                warms my heart to see her so playful and happy.

                Husky Kira constantly had joint problems and was eating grass
                because of abdominal pain. The vet was clueless what to do and
                then I discovered Canine Booster, tried it and am so happy! Just
                12 weeks later she’s 3kg lighter, has no more joint problems and
                almost never eats grass now. Thank you so much!

                I have been wavering back and forth... should I order Canine
                Booster or not? I couldn't imagine it would have any impact. But
                now I've ordered it for the 3rd time and I am completely
                satisfied. My German shepherd truly has a shinier coat and his
                food allergy is much improved. Unbelievable, but true. I also
                discussed it with my veterinarian and she said "TOP", keep
                feeding it."

            <span class="prod">How</span> to give Canine Booster to your pet?
          </h3>
          <p class="under-title">
            Including Canine Booster into your dog’s diet is easy - it comes in
            powder form and with a scoop which you use to sprinkle the
            appropriate amount of powder on your dog’s food once a day.
            <br />
            <br />
            The dosage depends on the weight of your dog. Check the table on the
            packaging which tells you how much Canine Booster you should give
            your dog.
            <br />
            <br />
            When you start giving Canine Booster to your dog it is recommended
            to spread the suggested dosage in smaller amounts throughout the day
            so their digestion adjusts better to it.

          <div class="info-card">
            <h4>Is your dog in pain?</h4>
            <p>
              Are you sure you haven’t missed the warning signs, since dogs are
              masters of hiding pain?
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <p>
              It is possible your dog is suffering and still wagging his tail
              because he loves you. He may jump on the couch and into the car,
              even though he has joint problems and will feel the consequences
              later.
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <p>
              That's why it is extremely important for your dog to have regular
              veterinary check-ups and to monitor even the smallest changes in a
              dog's behavior and movement.
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <p>
              Visits to the vet are costly! And every day that goes by and you
              don’t notice that your best friend has problems moving will bring
              more quiet suffering to your dog.
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <p>
              That's why we believe it's better to PREVENT problems instead of
              acting too late when the damage is already done. It brings
              unnecessary pain to your dog and the recovery takes longer

                “I have a crossbreed at the animal shelter, he came as a puppy
                in a very bad condition, worms, severe mite infestation and
                hardly any fur. We were able to improve his condition, but
                compared to other dogs of his age, he was very sluggish, lazy,
                easily irritable and there remained a permanent stomach problem
                and allergy. I have tried a number of foods and supplements
                without success.
                <br /><br />
                We were skeptical at first. But we've already spent quite a bit
                of money to improve his condition, so why not. An animal
                nutrition expert confirmed to me that the ingredients are all
                good/very good and if you buy everything individually it would
                be more expensive.
                <br /><br />
                He's now due 1 month. I have a completely different dog 🤩
                fitter, not so susceptible to irritation anymore and the bowel
                movements are normal! NORMAL!! I could hardly believe it . The
                fur became really soft and shiny after 2 weeks. It also tastes
                good to him.”

                The daily dosage depends on the weight of your dog. Smaller dogs
                weighing from 1-5 kg should get half a scoop daily, dogs that
                weigh 5-15 kg should get one scoop of Canine Booster a day.
                Bigger dogs that weigh from 15-25 kg should get one and a half

                You can still give it to a puppy younger than 12 months but you

                Most dog owners report that the well-being of their dogs
                improved a lot after taking Canine Booster! However if you stop
                giving Canine Booster to your dog the pre-existing health
                problems may come back.

                There are no side effects on taking Canine Booster and can
                therefore be taken together with other prescribed medication.

                Absolutely! All dogs after the age of 1 should be given Canine
                Booster to their food in order to feed their organism with vital
                nutrients and develop a healthy immune system. The store-bought
                food can never deliver everything your dog’s body needs.

                Most likely, the problem is temporary and occurs due to the
                introduction of a new food supplement.
                <br /><br />
                We advise you to reduce the initial amount a little, so that the
                puppy's body gets used to it, and then continue with the normal
                dose after a few days.
                <br /><br />
                If these problems persist for more than a few days (although the
                chances of this happening are extremely small), discontinue use
                and, if necessary, consult a veterinarian.
                <br /><br />
                *If your puppy is allergic to shellfish, always consult your
                veterinarian before use
